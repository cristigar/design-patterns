/**
 * **Description**
 *
 * Consider, you are building a house and you need doors. You can either put on
 * your carpenter clothes, bring some wood, glue, nails and all the tools
 * required to build the door and start building it in your house or you can
 * simply call the factory and get the built door delivered to you so that you
 * don't need to learn anything about the door making or to deal with the mess
 * that comes with making it.
 *
 * **In plain words**
 *
 * Simple factory simply generates an instance for client without exposing any
 * instantiation logic to the client.
 *
 * **Wikipedia says**
 *
 * In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating
 * other objects â€“ formally a factory is a function or method that returns
 * objects of a varying prototype or class from some method call, which is
 * assumed to be "new".
 *
